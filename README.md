# small_target_classifier

simple image classifier used to distinguish potential targets from background noise, it contains three types of models. default image dimensions for this classifier are 20x20

## types of models
- single image classifier, classic image classifier
- LSTM image pairs classifier, uses time information between frames to improve classification accuracy
- 3d image classifier, uses 3d convolutional layers to merge features from both images and improve accuracy
